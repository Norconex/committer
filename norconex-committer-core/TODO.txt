
- Add committer server

- Add chainable committers??

The method commit in AbstractFileQueueCommitter does not respect the order of the add and delete sent by the client. 
The order of operation is kept only if the command for add/delete for the same file are done with more than 1000 miliseconds apart.
I suggest to create an auto increment number like 2015/03/15/14/30/23/0001/fileNameHere
