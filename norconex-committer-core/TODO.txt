

- Do a memory committer queue and test swapping one for the other behaving
  just fine.

- Have option to retry batches by breaking them down into smaller chunks
  up to 1 at a time.

- Ensure no workDir collision (either in this project or caller).  Append
  committer index in case of multiple committers (or always)?

- Have installer for other committer?

- Make sur logging is sufficient when batching so people know what is going on.

- Rename maxRetryWait to retryDelay to avoid confusion.
- Add init and close methods.
- Have listeners for commit events.  
- Have a "clearQueue" method.
- Have a "clearRepository" method.
- Allow for multiple committers (and remove MultiCommitter?)
- Committer server (and a committer "client" that can round-robin between 
  committer servers?)


- Maybe: have a way to "route" documents to the proper committer based on 
  metadata field values. Either by having a "restrictTo" equivalent to those 
  found in Importer handlers, or else.
  This has to account for deletions, that do not have metadata properties, so
  could break the routing.  Maybe sending the deletion to all defined committers
  for deletions could do it.  

- Create a CSV/Spreadsheet Committer, with support for how to join multi-values.

- Add committer server

- Add chainable committers??
