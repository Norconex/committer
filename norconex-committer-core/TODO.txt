- Maybe: have a way to "route" documents to the proper committer based on 
  metadata field values. Either by having a "restrictTo" equivalent to those 
  found in Importer handlers, or else.
  This has to account for deletions, that do not have metadata properties, so
  could break the routing.  Maybe sending the deletion to all defined committers
  for deletions could do it.  

- Create a Spreadsheet Committer, with support for how to join multi-values.

- Add committer server

- Add chainable committers??
