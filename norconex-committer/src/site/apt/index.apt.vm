Welcome to Norconex Committer

  The Norconex Committer is a Java library responsible for "committing"
  or "applying" the result of a document extraction or transformation
  to a target data source.  It is used by the 
  {{{http://www.norconex.com/product/collector-http}Norconex HTTP Collector}}
  to handle files successfully crawled. Taken on its own, this is not an 
  "executable" product (but may one day become).

  The current stable version is <<${currentStableVersion}>>.

  []
  
  To be useful, concrete implementations for the 
  {{{./apidocs/com/norconex/committer/ICommitter.html}ICommitter}} interface 
  must be provided.  One is provided with the core committer library, mostly
  for troubleshooting purposes: {{{./apidocs/com/norconex/committer/impl/FileSystemCommitter.html}FileSystemCommitter}}
  
  Based on your target data source, Norconex may already 
  provide existing implementations for your data sources or can create one.  

  <<Norconex-supported committer implementations:>>

  * {{{http://www.norconex.com/product/committer-elasticsearch/}Elasticsearch Committer}} 

  * {{{http://www.norconex.com/product/committer-idol/}IDOL Committer}} 
  
  * More to come...

* Configuration

  Typically, when XML configuration is made available for committers, it is 
  of that form, where "class" must be replace with your concrete implementation
  of {{{./apidocs/com/norconex/committer/ICommitter.html}com.norconex.committer.ICommitter}}: 

+-------------------------------+
<committer class="..." />
+-------------------------------+
  
* Extend the Committer

  Maven users can easily add the necessary {{{./download.html}pom.xml}} 
  information to have all dependencies automatically resolved.  

  For others, create a new Java project in your
  favourite IDE. Add to your classpath all the files contained in the "lib" 
  folder of the Committer installation.
